<h1>2017/03/22 - Changelog v0.1.1</h1>
Ive posted the prototype on reddit and made some small adjustements to the game. I have removed the saving for now
so that I can implement a server side saving which enables me to do things like events with other players and
comparisons.
<ul>
    <li>Removed Saving for now (See above for reason)</li>
    <li>Changed name to XianXia</li>
    <li>Added random name generator</li>
    <li>Fixed most Buttons</li>
    <li>Changed Design to make it look less washed out(thanks /u/Fatul!</li>
    <li>Added Cultivation Insight (Improves your Cultivationtechnique bonus the more you gain insight on the
        technique)
    </li>
    <li>Luck Stat is now relevant</li>
    <li>On that note, started implementing characterstats (currently hidden)</li>
</ul>
